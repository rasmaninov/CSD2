Create a program that contains a class Instrument and a main function.
The constructor of Instrument has a parameter of type string that is used to set a printable string that indicates the sound which the instrument makes when played. For this assignment no audio is required: we represent the sound by printing text to the console.
The sound string is stored inside objects of type Instrument, so the class Instrument must contain a string variable (e.g. sound).
Instrument has as a member function play() that prints the sound string to the console.
Inside the main() function, instantiate two objects of Instrument, setting the instruments' sounds by
using the constructor.
Then call their play() functions, which will print the sound string to the console, something like “Ratatataaaa” or “fweeep”.
