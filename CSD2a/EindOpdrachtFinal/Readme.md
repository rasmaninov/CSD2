Welcome, this is the readme to my EINDOPDRACHT

Program to run is "Eindopdracht.py".

I built an irregular beat generator, based on weighted chance.

When opening up the program, it will ask for a bpm (from 20 to 400), after that
it will ask for a time signature, which consists of 2 variables. The first can be
from 1 to 16 and the second can be any power of 2, and 1.

Based on these three variables, it will now generate a loop, and play that loop.

When it's done playing the loop, the program asks if you want to save the loop
to the folder the program is in. If you say yes, choose a name and save. If no,
the program will continue.

After this the program will ask if you want to keep going, if yes, loop back to
the beginning, if no, the program will end.

Thanks!
